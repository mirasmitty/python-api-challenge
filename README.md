# python-api-challenge

# Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `VacationPy`: Folder containing the VacationPy script and related files.
    - `api_keys.py`: File containing relevant API keys for the project.
    - `VacationPy.ipynb`: File cotaining code for VacationPy analysis.
    - `output_data`: Folder containing the csv file with the results of the WeatherPy city information.
- `WeatherPy`: Folder containing the WeatherPy script and related files.
  - `api_keys.py`: File containing relevant API keys for the project
  - `output_data`: Folder containing the csv file with the results of the WeatherPy city information and generated figures.
  - `VacationPy.ipynb`: File cotaining code for WeatherPy analysis.
